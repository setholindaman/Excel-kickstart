# KickStart My Chart

## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. 

## Description

Organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or are currently "live" per **category**.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.

  * Create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.
